\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}
This report details the design, implementation, and technical analysis of an \textbf{Library Management System}. The primary motivation for this project is to address the common inefficiencies and limitations found in traditional, manual library operations. These challenges often include error-prone record-keeping, difficulty in tracking resource availability, and a lack of proactive communication with library members.

This project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and established software design patterns to deliver a robust, maintainable, and efficient software solution \cite{Booch2007}. The resulting application serves as a practical demonstration of OOP concepts applied to a real-world management problem \cite{GoF1994}.

\subsection{Goals and Objectives}
The project was guided by a set of clear technical and academic objectives. Figure \ref{fig:project_goals} visually summarizes the core goal and its supporting objectives. The primary goals were:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Functional:} To develop a fully functional console-based application capable of managing core library operations.
	\item \textbf{Academic:} To apply and demonstrate a strong, practical understanding of the four pillars of OOP.
	\item \textbf{Technical:} To explore and implement appropriate software design patterns to improve the system's design.
	\item \textbf{Practical:} To gain hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope of the Project}
\subsubsection{In Scope}
The features and functionalities implemented in the final system include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A secure authentication system for both members and librarians.
	\item Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the book catalogue.
	\item A complete loan management system.
	\item An interactive console-based user interface (CLI).
	\item Data persistence using local CSV files with a hashing mechanism for integrity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Out of Scope}
The following features were considered but explicitly excluded:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Graphical User Interface (GUI).
	\item Integration with a real-time relational database.
	\item Web-based or mobile client interfaces.
\end{itemize}
