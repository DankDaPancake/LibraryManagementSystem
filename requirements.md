# 1 General Requirements
- Execute as specified in the project guidelines
- Each group must have a minimum of 3 members and a maximum of 5 members.
- The group should designate one representative to submit the project.

# 2 Objectives

- Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to develop a functional and main-
tainable application.
- Understand and demonstrate the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, poly-
morphism, and abstraction.
- Explore and apply some appropriate software design patterns to solve real-world pro-
gramming problems effectively.
- Practice programming, software design, teamwork, documentation, and technical presen-
tation skills.

# 3 Project Requirements
## 3.1 Problem Statement

Students must develop a management system application using OOP principles. The topic is
open but must be related to management. Suggested examples include:

- Library Management System
## 3.2 Programming and Design Requirements
- Programming Language: C++
- The system must demonstrate the four core OOP principles:`Encapsulation`,`Inheritance`,`Polymorphism`, `Abstraction`
- At least two design patterns must be applied.

## 3.3 User Interface Requirements
- The application must include a friendly, clearly formatted, and fully interactive user
interface.
- Console-based UI is acceptable but must:
    - Support multi-level menu navigation and structured data input.
	- Clearly display output with proper formatting and user guidance.
	- Allow smooth and error-checked interaction.

- GUI is strongly encouraged. Recommended GUI frameworks for each language include:
		- C++:Qt, wxWidgets
		- Java: Java Swing, JavaFX
		- C#: WinForms, WPF

## 3.4 Technical Report

The report must include the following sections:

a. Group Introduction
- Group details: name, member names, student IDs.
- Individual contributions to the project.
- Self-evaluation of how well each requirement was met.

b. System Design Overview
- Description of the problem domain and chosen management topic.
- Show the main features that your system will support
- Draw UML class diagrams [Document Reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams-overview.html)

c. Application Flow
- Flowcharts of user interactions and main program logic.
- Description of key modules and components.
- Example input/output with screenshots.

d. Challenges and Future Enhancements

- Problems faced during development.
- Ideas for improvement or additional features.

## 3.5 Video Requirement

A short video (10-20 minutes) must be submitted along with the project to demonstrate the
functionality and features of your application.
